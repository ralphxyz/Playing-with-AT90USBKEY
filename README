This is a my own private project. I'm simply trying to use to use the 
AT90USBKEY that has a AT90USB1287 microcontroller to act as various usb 
devices. My ultimate gold is make to send Playstation2 controller
commands to my computer/PS3.

This is definitly not the cheapest way to connect a PS2 controller to a 
computer but I had the board lying arround and wanted to play with it.


To compile you will need the avr gcc libraries.
If you are on Fedora (16 at the time of writing) you should be able to get 
them from one of the basic repositories as well as the dfu-programmer
package, I remember I had some trouble when installing a dummy program
with the dfu-programmer because of some permissions in linux. Google is
your friend. The specific board I was using actually burned the security
fuse so everytime you program the board you need to fully erase it.

To build the program
make 

To program the device
make program
