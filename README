This is a my own private project. I'm simply trying to use to use the 
AT90USBKEY that has a AT90USB1287 microcontroller to act as various usb 
devices. My ultimate gold is make to send Playstation2 controller
commands to my computer/PS3.

This is definitly not the cheapest way to connect a PS2 controller to a 
computer but I had the board lying arround and wanted to play with it.
